# PipPipGo iOS CI/CD with Xcode Cloud

## Delivery policy

Use Xcode Cloud's included 25 compute hours per month initially. No paid plan was
purchased. Pull requests run simulator tests. Production releases archive the
`Prod` scheme, upload to App Store Connect, and distribute to an internal
TestFlight group. Submit a tested build for App Review deliberately and choose
manual public release. Uploading a build is not an App Store release.

Repository: `https://github.com/alikian/pippipgo-ios`
Project: `pipgogo.xcodeproj`; app target: `pipgogo`
Bundle ID: `com.pipgogo.ios`; signing team: `U47SMLD234`.

## Versioning

`Configurations/Version.xcconfig` is the single marketing-version source for
Local, Dev and Prod. It initially preserves `1.0`; change it intentionally for a
new release. `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1` is the local fallback.

Xcode Cloud owns the increasing build counter. `ci_post_clone.sh` writes its
`CI_BUILD_NUMBER` into ignored `Configurations/CIOverrides.xcconfig`, so test
and archive builds use the same number. Nothing is committed by the build.
For example, cloud builds 42 and 43 produce `1.0 (42)` and `1.0 (43)`.
Local Xcode builds do not increment a counter. Let cloud builds own distributed
build numbers; do not upload a local build with a number already used by Cloud.

Before the first upload, inspect existing builds in App Store Connect. Under
Xcode Cloud → Settings → Build Number, set Next Build Number above the highest
already uploaded number for the current version. This account state has not been
inspected. Do not assume `1` is still available.

## One-time activation in Xcode

The files in this repository are build hooks, not an activated hosted workflow.
Apple's initial Xcode Cloud enrollment is done through Xcode. No Apple credentials,
distribution certificates, App Store Connect API keys or AWS access keys are needed
in these scripts.

1. Sign in to Xcode with the Apple Developer account for team `U47SMLD234`.
   Confirm the App Store Connect app record uses `com.pipgogo.ios`.
2. Publish/merge the CI changes into the branches being built. Open
   `pipgogo.xcodeproj`, select `Prod`, and choose Product → Xcode Cloud →
   Create Workflow. Confirm the product/team and authorize access to the
   `alikian/pippipgo-ios` GitHub repository when Apple requests it.
3. Configure the two workflows below. Choose an available supported Xcode version
   and an iPhone simulator runtime compatible with the app's iOS 17 minimum.
   Record the chosen versions with the first successful cloud run; local validation
   used Xcode 27.0 (27A266a) and iOS 18.5.
4. Keep subscription usage at the included tier. Start with one simulator target
   per workflow and enable automatic cancellation of superseded builds if offered.
5. Run each workflow manually once. Verify test results, the signed archive,
   successful App Store Connect processing, and the installed TestFlight build.

### Workflow: Pull request checks

- Start condition: pull requests targeting `develop` or `main`.
- Scheme: `Dev`.
- Actions: Test on one available iPhone simulator, using scheme configuration.
- No archive or TestFlight post-action. No production identity variable needed.
- Existing unit tests use mocks; this does not prove live backend/device acceptance.

### Workflow: Production TestFlight

- Start condition: changes to `main`, plus manual runs. `develop` stays development.
- Scheme: `Prod` for both Test and Archive; configuration: use scheme settings.
- Workflow environment variable (public, not a secret):
  `PIPPIPGO_PROD_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=23sk8qfmpotjj40jbnl9tn33em`.
- Actions: Test on one iPhone simulator; Archive for iOS with distribution set to
  **TestFlight and App Store** so the tested build remains eligible for App Review.
  Do not select an internal-testing-only distribution option for release candidates.
- Post-action: TestFlight Internal Testing, select the intended internal tester
  group, and run distribution only when all required actions succeed.
- Keep public release manual in App Store Connect. Do not add automatic App Review
  submission as part of this initial workflow.

The generated, ignored `ProdIdentity.xcconfig` contains only the verified public
Cognito client ID. A missing, development or unexpected identity stops the build.
The hooks reject cloud archives of Local/Dev. Production unit-test actions enable
`@testable` support; archive actions explicitly disable it. The post-archive hook
checks the actual app plist for the Prod API, Prod authentication identity, bundle
ID, display name, version/build and absence of transport exceptions. A failure
must keep the workflow failed and prevent TestFlight distribution.

## First-release acceptance

- Verify cloud build numbers increase and the TestFlight version/build match.
- Verify the Prod archive targets `https://api.pippipgo.com` and
  `https://auth.pippipgo.com`, never development identity or storage.
- Complete the physical-device scenario in `docs/simple-travel-organizer.md`,
  including sign-in, account isolation, organizer operations and conflict handling.
- Follow backend `infra/prod-deployment.md` for launch limitations: Google consent
  is still Testing, the Prod Places key is not configured, and production phone
  acceptance is separate from mocked tests and provider inference checks.
- Complete store metadata, screenshots, privacy disclosures, review access and
  export-compliance answers before submitting for App Review.

## Local verification

```sh
python3 scripts/test_ci.py
xcodebuild test -project pipgogo.xcodeproj -scheme Prod \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES
xcodebuild archive -project pipgogo.xcodeproj -scheme Prod \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -archivePath /tmp/PipPipGo-Prod.xcarchive
scripts/verify_release.sh /tmp/PipPipGo-Prod.xcarchive/Products/Applications/pipgogo.app 1 1.0
```

Use an installed simulator and an unused output path. For local production builds,
generate the public identity from backend `scripts/export_prod_ios_config.py` first.
The cloud hooks are intended for a disposable checkout; do not run them in your
normal checkout because they write ignored cloud-only configuration.

## Evidence — September 30, 2026

- Ten isolated hook tests passed, including missing/Dev identity, malformed build
  numbers, fresh checkout, test-to-archive testability reset, invalid archive
  metadata and failed-build handling.
- All 88 Prod simulator tests passed with explicit testability enabled.
- Eight configuration tests also passed in a fresh checkout using only the cloud
  hooks to enable testability, with the next build number `43`.
- Signed archive from a fresh temporary checkout passed: `1.0 (42)`, Prod API
  and Cognito identity verified, `ENABLE_TESTABILITY=NO`, and strict code-signature
  validation passed. This is a local Apple Development signature; cloud distribution
  signing and App Store validation remain unverified.
- Hosted workflow enrollment, cloud signing/upload, TestFlight delivery, existing
  App Store build-number inspection and physical-device acceptance remain pending.
  The computer-use runtime could not start because the configured workspace path
  `/Users/alikianzadeh/git/pipgogo-ios` is a symlink; the real checkout is
  `/Users/alikianzadeh/git/pippipgo-ios`. No Apple account setting was changed.
